# Tsukuba-Hand-Prosthesis-Open-Source

Currently, myoelectric hand prostheses present physical and control challenges that hinder their effective use by children with unilateral congenital below-elbow deficiency (UCBED).
In the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Tsukuba, we conducted an investigation to address some of these challenges. 
Regarding the physical challenges, we focused on excessive weight, lack of hand size adaptability, and lack of socket size adaptability.
As for the control challenges, our focus was on the uncertain EMG measurement, absence of sensory feedback, and challenging EMG training.

To find clinically feasible solutions for these challenges, we proposed developing a myoelectric hand prosthesis for children with UCBED under personalized and modular design approaches.
We proposed a personalized approach to involve children in the design process, finding out and meeting the childrenâ€™s unique needs regarding myoelectric prosthetic hands to facilitate its adoption.
While, we adopted a modular approach to divide the prosthesis into interchangeable modules, providing flexibility to update the modules to adapt to children's developmental growth.
Both approaches were applied to all levels of the design of the prosthesis.

Results show that the developed myoelectric prosthesis presents potential solutions for the mentioned challenges.
As an outcome of the study and synthesis of the personalized and modular design approaches, the developed hand prosthesis, including the proposed solutions, are shared as open-source material. 
Thus, children have free access to a myoelectric hand prosthesis that can be customized to suit their evolving growth patterns and personal preferences.
Furthermore, thanks to their modularity, the prosthesis's modules can be interchanged and used with other prostheses, such as controlling a specific-activity prosthesis while using our proposed prosthesis interface.
